## Founders and Coders Week 1 Project

A static site built with Jeykll and served by Github pages.
A place to find out about our team and the projects we'll be making at [founders and coders](http://foundersandcoders.org/).

### Methodology

We stripped back the default Jekyll installation and started from scratch.  
The template you see is our own work, although there are still some remnants of default code.
