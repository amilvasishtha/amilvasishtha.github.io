## How did I create it?

I decided to use the Bootstrap template [Grayscale] (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) as the starting base for my page.

I really wanted to create a single page site with a variety of sections which could either be scrolled to or jumped to from the navbar.

So far, I am happy with how it's turned out.

## Why did I create it?

I wanted to create a page where I could showcase some of my abilities and experiment with some more design.

I also want to add some additional features aka it's a work in progress!

## What issues am I facing?

Currently struggling with the responsiveness.
