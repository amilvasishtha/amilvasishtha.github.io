## How did I create it?

I decided to use the Bootstrap template [Grayscale] (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) as the starting base for my page.

I am happy with how it's turned out. I really wanted a single page site with a variety of sections.

## Why did I create it?

I wanted to create a page where I could showcase some of my abilities and experiment with some design.

It's still a work in progress!

## What issues am I facing?

Currently struggling with the responsiveness.
